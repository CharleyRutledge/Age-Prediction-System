# Age Prediction System by Charley Rutledge 
## How to download
Please click the **Code** button and Click **Download Zip** or clone the repository.

## How to run
**Please Note: There is a link that allows you open the notebook directly in the Final_year_Project.ipynb**

### Step 1
After opening the notebook, connect to a runtime by clicking **connect** in the top right corner or in the navbar in the top left, select **Runtime** and Please select **T4 GPU**. For this project Google Colab Pro was used which gave access to High RAM and more powerful GPU's.

### Step 2
after connecting to a runtime, click the **runtime** button again select **Run all**. 
This will execute the cells of code inside the notebook.

## Restrictions
This project uses google Drive to store the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded by clicking [DropBox Link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ebg1vr6bng0ayri5hf5bi/combined_faces_train_augmented-001.zip?rlkey=ege15x9dvoop3f053d51d18az&dl=0) for ease of access however mounting the driver is necessary as there is over 234,000 images and this is a storage issue.
The dataset was obtained from [Skillcate](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/skillcate/merged-augmented-utk-faces-facial-age-dataset)

Running the project will produce different results each time so the values may not reflect the project that is stored in the repository.

## Viewing the results
The folder Results has stored the trained model and the weights along with any charts and results generated by the model.
